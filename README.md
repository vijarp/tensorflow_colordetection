# TensorFlow Color Detection

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of red and blue color detection using TensorFlow. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of detecting and classifying red and blue colors in images.

## Features
- Simple implementation of color detection using TensorFlow.
- Supports detection of red and blue colors.
- Demonstrates basic concepts of image preprocessing and TensorFlow model training.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijarp/tensorflow_colordetection.git
   cd tensorflow_colordetection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook red_blue.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset or provide your images containing red and blue colors.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the images, train the model, and visualize the results.
3. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with other colors or configurations.
